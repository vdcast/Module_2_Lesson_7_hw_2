**Lesson's topic:**

ViewPager.

**Technical task:**

Create an application "Toast Generator".
1) There is only one button on the main screen: "GET TOAST" and beautiful design.
2) Inside the application, an array of toasts. When you click on the button, the text of a random toast appears.
3) When the button is pressed - play a sound.
4) Figure out on your own how to randomly choose toasts and how to play the sound.
5) Already shown toasts should not be shown again. And when all the toasts are over, you need to start all over again.
6) Before the main screen appears, three onboarding screens are shown (scroll through the ViewPager), On each screen there is a picture + description, and on the last one there is also a “Start” button.
7) Examples of descriptions: “Just press the button”, “And a toast will appear”, “Enjoy!”

**Result: Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
